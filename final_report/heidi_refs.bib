	abstract = {Background: British Columbia, like many jurisdictions, has a health information telephone service (8-1-1) to provide callers with information by registered nurses and help them decide whether to attend an emergency department or primary care clinic, or manage their concern at home. We describe a new service, HealthLink BC Emergency iDoctor-in-assistance (HEiDi), that partnered physicians available by videoconferencing with 8-1-1 registered nurses to support callers.Methods: From Apr. 6 to Aug. 2, 2020, all callers to the 8-1-1 telephone service (available to anyone in BC) categorized as {\textquotedblleft}seek care within 24 hours{\textquotedblright} by registered nurses were eligible for referral to HEiDi. HEiDi physicians ({\textquotedblleft}virtual physicians{\textquotedblright}) connected directly with callers via desktop videoconferencing software, assessed their health complaint, provided advice and suggested care disposition. We conducted a descriptive study and collected demographic characteristics, health concern and disposition determined by the virtual physician.Results: HEiDi virtual physicians provided 7687 consultations. Most patients (n = 4439, 57.8\%) were in the 20{\textendash}64 age range, and 4814 (62.9\%) were female. Common health concerns were related to gastroenterology (n = 1275, 16.6\%), respiratory (n = 877, 11.4\%) and dermatology (n = 874, 11.4\%). From the 7531 calls with available data, 2548 (33.8\%) callers were advised to attempt home treatment, 2885 (38.3\%) to contact a primary care physician within 1 week, 1131 (15.0\%) to attend an emergency department immediately and 538 (7.1\%) to attend their primary provider now.Interpretation: We found that virtual physicians were able to advise nearly 3 out of 4 (72.1\%) patients away from in-person emergency or clinic assessment and 1 in 7 (15.0\%) to seek immediate emergency department care. Virtual physicians can provide an effective complement to a provincial health telephone system.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work was to develop a predictive model to aid non-clinical dispatchers to classify emergency medical call incidents by their life-threatening level (yes/no), admissible response delay (undelayable, minutes, hours, days) and emergency system jurisdiction (emergency system/primary care) in real time. We used a total of 1 244 624 independent incidents from the Valencian emergency medical dispatch service in Spain, compiled in retrospective from 2009 to 2012, including clinical features, demographics, circumstantial factors and free text dispatcher observations. Based on them, we designed and developed DeepEMC2, a deep ensemble multitask model integrating four subnetworks: three specialized to context, clinical and text data, respectively, and another to ensemble the former. The four subnetworks are composed in turn by multi-layer perceptron modules, bidirectional long short-term memory units and a bidirectional encoding representations from transformers module. DeepEMC2 showed a macro F1-score of 0.759 in life-threatening classification, 0.592 in admissible response delay and 0.757 in emergency system jurisdiction. These results show a substantial performance increase of 12.5\%, 17.5\% and 5.1\%, respectively, with respect to the current in-house triage protocol of the Valencian emergency medical dispatch service. Besides, DeepEMC2 significantly outperformed a set of baseline machine learning models, including naive bayes, logistic regression, random forest and gradient boosting (Î±=0.05). Hence, DeepEMC2 is able to: 1) capture information present in emergency medical calls not considered by the existing triage protocol, and model complex data dependencies not feasible by the tested baseline models. Likewise, our results suggest that most of this unconsidered information is present in the free text dispatcher observations. To our knowledge, this study describes the first deep learning model undertaking emergency medical call incidents classification. Its adoption in medical dispatch centers would potentially improve emergency dispatch processes, resulting in a positive impact in patient wellbeing and health services sustainability.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work has been supported by the Ag{\`e}ncia Valenciana de Seguretat i Resposta a les Emerg{\`e}ncies project A180017304-1, the Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovaci{\'o}n y Universidades of Spain program FPU18/06441 and the EU Horizon 2020 project InAdvance 825750.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:Participation consent protocols, as provided by the Health Services Department of the Valencian Community.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

	abstract = {Background The triage of patients in pre-hospital care is a difficult task, and improved risk assessment tools are needed both at the dispatch center and on the ambulance to differentiate between low- and high-risk patients. This study develops and validates a machine learning-based approach to predicting hospital outcomes based on routinely collected prehospital data.Methods Dispatch, ambulance, and hospital data were collected in one Swedish region from 2016 - 2017. Dispatch center and ambulance records were used to develop gradient boosting models predicting hospital admission, critical care (defined as admission to an intensive care unit or in-hospital mortality), and two-day mortality. Model predictions were used to generate composite risk scores which were compared to National Early Warning System (NEWS) scores and actual dispatched priorities in a similar but prospectively gathered dataset from 2018.Results A total of 38203 patients were included from 2016-2018. Concordance indexes (or area under the receiver operating characteristics curve) for dispatched priorities ranged from 0.51 {\textendash} 0.66, while those for NEWS scores ranged from 0.66 - 0.85. Concordance ranged from 0.71 {\textendash} 0.80 for risk scores based only on dispatch data, and 0.79 {\textendash} 0.89 for risk scores including ambulance data. Dispatch data-based risk scores consistently outperformed dispatched priorities in predicting hospital outcomes, while models including ambulance data also consistently outperformed NEWS scores. Model performance in the prospective test dataset was similar to that found using cross-validation, and calibration was comparable to that of NEWS scores.Conclusions Machine learning-based risk scores outperformed a widely-used rule-based triage algorithm and human prioritization decisions in predicting hospital outcomes. Performance was robust in a prospectively gathered dataset, and scores demonstrated adequate calibration. Future research should investigate the generality of these results to prehospital triage in other settings, and establish the impact of triage tools based on these methods by means of randomized trial.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementFunding for this study was provided by the Swedish Innovation Agency (Vinnova grant number 2017-04652).Author DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesAny clinical trials involved have been registered with an ICMJE-approved registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov and the trial ID is included in the manuscript.Not ApplicableI have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines and uploaded the relevant Equator, ICMJE or other checklist(s) as supplementary files, if applicable.YesOur ethics approval limits us to the publication of results at the aggregate level only, precluding us from publishing individual-level patient data.
